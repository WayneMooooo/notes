# STC comments
——*A Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning Method Based On Genetic Algorithm*
> STC can uniformly cover the large grid area composed of four small grids which contain no obstacles. 

> The DARP algorithm is limited by the starting position of each robot, what's more, due to the expansion of obstacles in STC algorithm itself, it is limited to be greatly affected by the map environment.
